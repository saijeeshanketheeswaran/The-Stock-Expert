 ## To Run
 
When you are running the android app, and when you click the stock in the app and it goes to a new activity, after that open the terminal where the tensor.py is. In the terminal, type in python3 tensor.py (or "python tensor.py" depending on what version you have), which will show a graph for the stock you picked.
    
If you are missing packages, install the packages that are needed which are in the in the first couple of lines in the tensor.py file. It should show errors of what packages are needed when you run the file in terminal.

When running the python file, it takes a really long time for the program to learn the data. Can take up to 3 hours.
